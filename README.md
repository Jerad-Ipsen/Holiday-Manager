# Holiday-Manager

This is a holiday manager application made in python that allows users to add, remove, view (work in progress), 
and save holidays to a list and can be stored in a json file. In addition, the application has already scraped two
sources for holidays, including a json file as well as an api that contains holidays. Holidays included are from two
years before and two years after 2022.

This repo includes:
- the main application as a python file
- a short python file that includes some base psuedocode for the planning process

The repo does not include the config file that contains stored information necessary to sun the application
