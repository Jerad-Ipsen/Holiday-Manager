# Holiday-Manager

  This is a holiday manager application made in python that allows users to add, remove, view (work in progress), 
and save holidays to a list and can be stored in a json file. In addition, the application has already scraped two
sources for holidays, including a JSON file as well as an API that contains holidays. Holidays included are from two
years before and two years after 2022.

This repo includes:
- The main application as a python file
- A short python file that includes some base psuedocode for the planning process
- A JSON file that contains base holidays read into the main python application

The repo does not include the config file that contains stored information necessary to sun the application.
