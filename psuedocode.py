# import necessary packages

# declare dataclasses for holiday (attrs - name, date, weather) and holidaylist (list of holiday objects)

# scrape json and api for holiday names and dates, 
    # json will have a simple for loop
    # api will need a for loop and potentially if statements to help parse through tags

# begin main application
    # whole thing will be wrapped in a while loop that will only be broken out of in the exit menu
    # There will be an if stetement right after the while loop introduction to decide which menu selection is made based on user input
    # all sub menus will introduce a while loop to stay in that menu until an action the user makes should return them to the main menu under the main while loop
    # another if statement will be used imediataly after the while loop in each sub menu to make dceisions based on user input.
